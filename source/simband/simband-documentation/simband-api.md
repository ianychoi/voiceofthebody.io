# Simband API

## Access the [Simband API](/simband-api/annotated.html)

Simband APIs are constantly evolving along with Simband. We welcome your feedback.
{:.warning}

The Simband API is written in C and comes along with C++ wrapper convenience funtions which can potentially make developers life little easier. Atleast we hope so. :)
 
Simband's API enables developers to get real-time access to sensors and algorithms data. Currently developers can access data from all the [available streams](/simband/simband-documentation/semantics-of-simband/types-streams) on the system, to build their own algorithms. 

The Simband API documentation is automatically generated from our software, thanks to doxygen.
