# Bioinformatics

Welcome to project Bioinformatics.

This is a data repository of vital signs we are building with Simband. We don't assume that all Simband and SAMI developers will have ready access to living informationâ€”with that thought in mind, we created project Bioinformatics.

We are actively adding de-indentified vital sign data to this repository. In the future, you will find studies conducted using different sensors, and additional contributions from our partners.

We are excited to share the data we have collected so far, and we look forward to hearing your feedback. We are interested to know how you plan to use this data and how it can be helpful in your research. Our aim is to encourage innovative or even revolutionary ways to analyze data and gather insights on the human body. Surprise us with amazing projects, and help people collect better information about themselves. We are also seeking some feedback on our data collection methods and how we might improve them. Have suggestions on future study? Please use the feedback button to share your ideas.
