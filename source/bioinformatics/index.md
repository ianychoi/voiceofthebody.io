# Bioinformatics

Welcome to project Bioinformatics.

This is a data repository of vital signs we are building with Simband. We don't assume that all Simband and SAMI developers will have ready access to living information—with that thought in mind, we created project Bioinformatics.

On these pages, you will find actual data from a variety of participants, which we encourage you to download and experiment with. Data are available via direct download. 

We are excited to share the data we have collected so far, and we look forward to hearing your feedback. In particular, we are seeking feedback on our data collection methods and how we might improve them. We are also interested in how you plan to use this data and how it can be helpful in your research. Our aim is to encourage innovative or even revolutionary ways to analyze data and gather insights on the human body. Surprise us with amazing projects, and help people collect better information about themselves.

We are actively adding de-indentified vital sign data to this repository. In the future, you will find studies conducted using different sensors, and additional contributions from our partners.

With each set of data we collect, we define a data collection "protocol." This is made available so that you can understand exactly what we have collected and how. When we collect data according to a given protocol, this is called a "study." Each study focuses on a different physical or mental activity, and uses a particular combination of sensors. Below you can find a list of our studies so far.
