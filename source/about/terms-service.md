##Samsung SAMIIO Platform Terms of Service

**Last Updated: March 2015**

Welcome to the Samsung SAMIIO Platform (the “Platform”). Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Samsung”, “we”, “us” or “our”) provides certain features, software, tools, and other products and services (“Services”) to you (“you”, “your” or “Users”) on or through our Platform. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms of Service for that organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms of Service (in which case, “you”, “your” and “User” will refer to that organization).

**Please read these Terms of Service carefully. They are a legal agreement between you and us that govern your use of the Platform. By using the Platform or the Services, you are agreeing to these Terms of Service.  If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use the Platform or any of the Services.**

1. ***You Retain Ownership of your Content.*** You retain ownership of the information, materials, documents, media files or other data or content that you upload, transmit, create, post, display or otherwise provide on or through the Services (“User Content”).  Other than the rights you grant to Samsung under these Terms of Service, Samsung does not claim ownership of or any other rights to your User Content, and you retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in your User Content. In other words, the User Content that belongs to you remains yours.

2. ***Privacy and Protection of your Personal Data.***
  
    2.1 Our Privacy Policy, located at [http://www.voiceofthebody.io/privacy](http://www.voiceofthebody.io/privacy), explains how Samsung handles your personal data and information and protects your privacy when you use the Platform and the Services. By using the Platform or the Services, you agree that any personal data and information that you provide to us are subject to our Privacy Policy.

3. ***Other Applicable Terms.*** We offer a variety of Services, and you may use the Services to locate, browse and/or download applications, data files, services and other content, that may be offered by third parties that are not affiliated with Samsung (collectively, “Third Party Products”).  Additional terms of service may apply to some of our Services or to some Third Party Products. If you use any Services or Third Party Products that require additional terms of service (“Special Terms”), you will need to agree to those Special Terms. If any Special Terms are inconsistent with these Terms of Service, the Special Terms will control.

4. *** Account and Registration Data.***
    
    4.1 To use the Services, you will need to register and open an account.  Your account will be created using Samsung’s single sign on process (“SingleSignOn”).  Once you open an account with Samsung, SingleSignOn automatically registers you for all Samsung services, and you can sign on and sign off from all Samsung services and through all devices at once. 
    
    4.2 You can access and change your password or registration data at any time by either accessing the relevant Samsung account application on your device or by visiting [https://account.samsung.com/](https://account.samsung.com/). 
    
    4.3 You will keep your account safe and secure at all times, in particular by avoiding obvious user names or passwords, and by changing your password regularly. 
    
    4.4 You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name  and password, and for any and all activity that occurs under your account, so you should not disclose your password(s) or grant any third party access to your account. Samsung may treat any instructions as coming from you if they are received from or issued by a third party using your user name and password or registration data.
    
    4.5 You agree not to use the account of any other user without permission of the user or person holding the respective account.
    
    4.6 You will let us know immediately if you learn of any unauthorized use of any of your account or registration data or any other breach of security.

    5.2 Samsung may also disable your account at any time and without notice if:

      * We believe that you are in breach of these Terms of Service.
      * You have demonstrated (whether directly or through your actions or statements or otherwise) that you do not intend to comply with these Terms of Service;
      * We or any of our suppliers or partners believe the law requires us to do so; or
      * We decide to stop providing the Services.

    5.3 Terminating this Agreement will not prejudice any rights, obligations and liabilities that you or Samsung have accrued or incurred while these Terms of Service were in effect.

    5.4 If Samsung disables access to your account, you may not be able to access or use the Services, your account details or any files, including your User Content, or Third Party Products that are stored with your account.  Samsung may allow you to backup the User Content that you have stored with Samsung through the use of the Services.  You understand that Samsung may delete your User Content or may retain your User Content indefinitely.

5. **Our Use of Data and Developer Products**

    5.1 ***Our Access to Developer Products.*** During the Term, if we request access to your Developer Products, which we intend to use for Platform-development purposes, you agree to provide us with access, even if your Developer Product is incomplete.

    5.2 ***Samsung’s Use of Developer Products.***  You hereby grant Samsung and its affiliates, during the Term, a worldwide, royalty-free and fully paid up, non-exclusive license, without rights to sublicense, to use, reproduce, distribute, perform, or display Developer Products for the purpose of developing, modifying, marketing, promoting, sponsoring or otherwise commercializing the Platform.  Samsung may not sell, license or otherwise transfer the Developer Products.

    5.3 ***Collection and Use of Personal and Non-Personal Data.***

      * Our Privacy Policy, located at [http://www.voiceofthebody.io/privacy](http://www.voiceofthebody.io/privacy), explains how Samsung handles your personal data and information and protects your privacy when you use the Developer Kit and Platform. By using the Developer Kit and Platform, you agree that any personal data and information that you provide to us are subject to our Privacy Policy.
      * You agree that Samsung and its affiliates may collect and use technical and related information that is gathered periodically, including but not limited to information about your Developer Products, computer, system software, other software and peripherals. Samsung may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve the Developer Kit, to provide services, if any, related to the Developer Kit, verify compliance with this Agreement or for other business purposes.  You agree to obtain all consents from the users of your Developer Products necessary for Samsung to use this information.

6. **Ownership of Intellectual Property**

    6.1 ***Samsung Intellectual Property.*** Except for the limited licenses granted to you in this Agreement, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Developer Kit, Confidential Information, Platform and any Updates that are made available to you under this Agreement, including but not limited to all related changes, improvements, derivative works and intellectual property rights (“Samsung IP”) remain, at all times, the sole and exclusive property of Samsung. You agree to cooperate with Samsung to maintain Samsung's ownership of the Samsung IP, and you agree to promptly provide notice of any claims or threatened claims relating to the Samsung IP. Other than the license rights expressly set out in this Agreement, Samsung does not grant to you and you do not receive, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any ownership right, title or interest nor any security interest or other interest in any intellectual property rights relating to the Developer Kit, nor in any copy of any part of the foregoing, nor any other licenses, immunity or rights, express or implied. 

    6.1 ***Your Intellectual Property.*** Except for the rights granted to Samsung in this Agreement, you and your licensors retain all right, title and interest in the Developer Products.  Except for the Samsung IP, you may, subject to the terms of this Agreement, use, disclose, reproduce, distribute or otherwise exploit any ideas, suggestions or other feedback Samsung provides to you or your licensors regarding any Developer Product.

7. **Our Rights and Obligations Under this Agreement**

    7.1 ***Updates and Maintenance.*** Samsung expects to support and improve the Platform and Developer Kit over time.  In order to do this, we may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the Developer Kit, with or without notice. If Samsung makes any Updates available, those Updates will be governed by this Agreement—except that if a separate license is provided with the Update, then the terms of that license will govern the Update. Any updates may have APIs, features, services and/or functionality that are different from those found in the Developer Kit licensed under this Agreement. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your Developer Product functions properly after any such Update.  You acknowledge that we have no obligation to provide any maintenance, technical or other support in respect of the Developer Kit.

    7.2 ***Development of the Platform.*** You understand and agree that:

      * The Platform is in the early stages of development;
      * Samsung may change the name of the Platform (or its parts);
      * Samsung may decide whether to and how to develop and promote the Platform; 
      * The Platform may not support the commercialization of any Developer Product;
      * Samsung may choose not to use, accept, certify or otherwise support any Developer Product; and
      * Samsung will not be liable for its actions or omissions relating to the implementation of the Platform.  
    
    7.3 ***Test Kits.*** From time to time, we may offer you test versions of the Developer Kit. You acknowledge and agree that you must not rely on such test versions to perform in the same manner as a final-release commercial-grade product and you should not use such test versions with data that is not sufficiently backed up on a regular basis. 

    7.4 ***Rejection of Developer Products.***  We may reject your Developer Product any time and for any reason, including but not limited to our determination that the Developer Product is inappropriate or violates this Agreement or violates any applicable law or regulation. Samsung may choose to test a Developer Product, but testing of a Developer Product does not mean that Samsung has approved the Developer Product or any aspect of the Developer Product.

8. **Your Obligations for Use of the Platform or Developer Kit**

    8.1 ***Your Representations and Warranties.***  You represent and warrant to Samsung that:
    
      * (i) you have the requisite legal, and if applicable, corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and perform your obligations under this Agreement, and this Agreement does not conflict with any other agreement or obligation by which you are bound; (ii) you are and will be responsible for your Authorized Users’ use of the Platform and Developer Kit and their compliance with this Agreement;  and (iii) you will be solely responsible for all activities you and your Authorized Users undertake in connection with the Platform, the Developer Kit, the Developer Products and the development of Developer Products.
      * your Developer Product: (i) is free from material errors and defects; (ii) has been designed and developed for installation and operation solely on devices that you have fully tested and approved; and (iii) will operate with the Platform.
      * use of your Developer Product does not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of any third party, and Samsung’s use of any of these products, materials or services does not and will not infringe any proprietary rights of any third party, and you shall immediately notify Samsung in the event of any such infringement.
      * your Developer Product does not, and will not when delivered or provided, contain any computer code designed to disrupt, disable, harm, or otherwise impede in any manner the operation thereof, or any other associated software, firmware, hardware, computer system or network (sometimes referred to as “viruses” or “worms”), and you have taken reasonable steps to test for, and have found no such viruses or worms.
    
    8.2 ***General Conditions and Requirements.*** You acknowledge and agree that your Developer Products must comply with the conditions and requirements set out below:
    
      * You will not, through use of the Developer Kit or otherwise, create any Developer Product or other program that would disable, hack or otherwise interfere with any security, digital signing, digital rights management, content protection, verification or authentication mechanisms implemented in or through the Platform, this Developer Kit, or other Samsung software, services or technology, or enable others to do so.
      * You (i) will comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements; (ii) will comply with all applicable laws and regulations of any jurisdiction in which the Developer Products are offered or made available, including all regulatory and legal requirements applicable to the creation, testing, and use of any Developer Product (or any component of the Developer Product); and (iii) are solely responsible for obtaining all required and necessary permissions and/or approvals from relevant government or regulatory authorities. 
      * You will ensure that any Developer Product introduced into interstate commerce, as of the date of that introduction, is not adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and is not an article which may not, under the provisions of section 404, 505, or 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, be introduced into interstate commerce.  
      * If the Developer Product may collect, transmit, maintain, process, share, disclose or otherwise use personal information, location information, health information or other data that relates to a user ("User Information Handling"), you must comply, and the Developer Product must be compliant, with all applicable privacy and data collection laws and regulations with respect to such User Information Handling. Applicable laws and regulations may include the privacy and security regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). You must ensure that any processing or transmission of user data is conducted in a manner that preserves the accuracy and security of the data. If your Developer Product engages in User Information Handling, you are required to maintain a privacy policy and inform the users of your Developer Product of your privacy policy. Your privacy policy must (i) comply with applicable laws and regulations, (ii) inform users of the information collected by your Developer Product and how that information is used, stored, secured and disclosed, and (iii) describe the controls that users have over the use and sharing of their information, and how they may access their information. Additional minimum requirements for your privacy policy are set forth in Exhibit B.
      * You must not design or market Developer Products for the purpose of violating any legal rights of any person (including but not limited to privacy rights). 
      * In addition, and without limiting your obligations to follow all applicable laws and regulations, you must ensure that any Developer Product that offers health information or location information based services or functionality notifies and obtains consent from an individual before the individual’s health or location data is collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Developer Product. In addition, Developer Products that use health information based APIs shall comply with any registration process that we may implement. 
      * If a Developer Product captures, collects or records any form of user or device data, images, pictures or voice data (collectively "Recordings"), or processes, maintains, uploads, syncs, or transmits any form of user data, content or information (collectively "Transmissions"), such Recordings and Transmissions must comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to privacy laws) as well as any policies or requirements that Samsung may provide to you. In particular, you must ensure that a reasonably distinctive and conspicuous visual or audio indication that a Recording is taking place is displayed or played to the user as part of the Developer Product.
      * You will be solely responsible for any and all claims and/or damages arising from or related to the download or use of interpreted code in any Developer Product, other than the code that is interpreted and run by the documented Application Programming Interface(s) and built-in interpreters contained in the Developer Kit, except as authorized otherwise by Samsung in advance in writing.
      * If your Developer Products use location-based APIs for real-time route guidance, you must have an end user license agreement that includes the following notice: "REAL TIME LOCATION DATA ACCESSED VIA THIS DEVELOPER PRODUCT MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. YOUR USE OF THIS DEVELOPER PRODUCT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK." You shall not use the Developer Product for life support devices or other devices that may cause deaths, injuries or severe physical or environmental losses. Any attempt to do so shall be deemed as a material breach under this Agreement.
      * Developer Products must not disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Samsung-implemented system including, but not limited to, those that are intended to notify a user that the user's location data is being collected, transmitted, maintained, processed or used, or intended to obtain consent for such use. Developer Products may not provide services for which the user's consent has been denied or withdrawn.
      * If a Developer Product includes any Third Party Software, you must comply with all licensing terms applicable to such Third Party Software. However, you shall separate the Third Party Software from Developer Kit in your Developer Product and shall not cause any part of the Developer Kit in your Developer Product, any derivative works thereof, and/or Samsung’s Confidential Information to be subject to the licensing terms applicable to such Third Party Software (e.g., public disclosure, public distribution). You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Samsung, its distributors and its customers from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) and liabilities arising out of or in relation to the use of Third Party Software.
      * If your Developer Product includes any Open Source Software, (i) you are responsible for compliance with all applicable Open Source Software license terms, including any source code availability requirements, and (ii) your Developer Product must not cause any non-Open Source Software (including Samsung-proprietary software) to become subject to the terms of any Open Source Software license.
      * You will promptly respond to Samsung regarding the use of policies and APIs in connection with the Developer Product and/or Developer Kit, upon Samsung’s request. 
      * You will not attempt to hide or obscure any features, functionality or content in your Developer Product.
      * You will not exploit the Developer Kit in any unauthorized manner.
      * Your end user terms and conditions must meet the minimum requirements and include the minimum terms and conditions attached as Exhibit C. 

9. **Confidentiality**

    9.1 ***Confidential Information.*** You acknowledge and agree that the any information you receive from Samsung that is designated as confidential, or that would be reasonably understood to be confidential constitutes "Confidential Information" for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that you can demonstrate by written evidence: (i) is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach by you, (ii) that Samsung has generally made available to the public, (iii) that you independently developed without use or reliance of any Confidential Information, (iv) that you lawfully obtained from a third party who has the right to transfer or disclose the information to you without limitation, or (v) any Open Source Software included in the Developer Kit, the licensing terms of which do not contain obligations of confidentiality.

    9.2 ***Use and Protections of Confidential Information.*** You must protect Confidential Information using a degree of care that is no less than that which you use to protect your own confidential information of the same or similar importance (and in any event, no less than a reasonable degree of care). You may use Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising your rights and performing your obligations under this Agreement and you must not use Confidential Information for any other purpose, or for your own or any third party’s benefit, without the prior written consent of Samsung. You may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law, as long as you take reasonable steps to notify Samsung of the relevant requirement before disclosing the Confidential Information and you take reasonable steps to obtain protective treatment against disclosure of the Confidential Information. You acknowledge that any disclosure, use or misappropriation of Confidential Information of Samsung in violation of this Agreement would cause Samsung irreparable harm for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, you agree that Samsung shall have the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief and specific performance, without prejudice to any remedies otherwise available to Samsung at law or in equity.

    9.3 ***Your Disclosures.***  Samsung works with many application and software developers and some of their products may be similar to or compete with your Developer Products. Samsung may also be developing its own similar or competing applications and products or may decide to do so in the future. To avoid potential misunderstandings, Samsung cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any information that you may provide in connection with this Agreement, including information about your Developer Product (such disclosures will be referred to as “Disclosures”). You agree that any such Disclosures will be non-confidential. Samsung will be free to use and disclose any Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating you. You release Samsung from all liability and obligations that may arise from the receipt, review, use, or disclosure of any portion of any Disclosures. Any physical materials you submit to Samsung will become Samsung property and Samsung will have no obligation to return those materials to you or to certify their destruction. 

10. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY**

    ALL PLATFORM AND DEVELOPER KIT MATERIALS OR RELATED SERVICES FROM SAMSUNG ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, AND SAMSUNG MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE PLATFORM OR DEVELOPER KIT MATERIALS, UPDATES OR ANY RELATED SERVICES AND SAMSUNG EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.  YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM OR DEVELOPER KIT, INCLUDING ANY UPDATES OR RELATED SERVICES, IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE PLATFORM, DEVELOPER KIT MATERIALS, INCLUDING ANY UPDATES, OR RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR LOSS OF DATA. FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLARITY, THE PLATFORM AND DEVELOPER KIT, INCLUDING UPDATES OR RELATED SERVICES, ARE LICENSED “AS-IS” AND YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. SAMSUNG GIVES NO EXPRESS AND/OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, GUARANTEE OR CONDITIONS. 

11. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

    SUBJECT TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED AND PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SAMSUNG SHALL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY THROUGH YOU FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR DELAY OF DELIVERY, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE DEVELOPER KIT, PLATFORM OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR YOUR DEVELOPMENT OF DEVELOPER PRODUCTS, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SAMSUNG HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR IS AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. YOUR UNDERSTANDING, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE THE LEGAL BASIS AND CONSIDERATION FOR THE LICENSES GRANTED UNDER IT.  In no event shall Samsung’s total liability to you under this Agreement for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the greater of the amount paid to Samsung for the Developer Kit or the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

12. **Indemnity**

    12.1 To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Samsung, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each a "Samsung Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively "Losses") incurred by a Samsung Indemnified Party as a result of your (or your Authorized User’s) breach of this Agreement, any claims that your Developer Product violates or infringes any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or otherwise related to or arising from your (or any Authorized User’s) use of the Developer Kit, Platform, other products and services provided by Samsung under this Agreement or your Developer Product or your (or any Authorized User’s) development or distribution of any Developer Product (each a “Claim”).

    12.2 You acknowledge that the Developer Kit is not intended to be used in the development of any Developer Product where death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage could result from errors or inaccuracies in the content, data or information provided by the Developer Product or by Developer Product failures. To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Samsung Indemnified Party from any Losses incurred by such Samsung Indemnified Party as a result of your use of the Developer Kit in the development of any such Developer Products. 

    12.3 You must not enter into a settlement or like agreement with any third party that affects Samsung's rights or binds Samsung in any way related to or arising from your (or your Authorized User’s) use of the Developer Kit without the prior written consent of Samsung.

13. **How This Agreement May Be Terminated***

    13.1 ***Right to Terminate.*** (a) You can terminate this Agreement immediately by stopping your use of the Developer Kit; and (b) Samsung can terminate this Agreement immediately, (i) if you have or we believe that you have breached any terms of this Agreement; (ii) if we are required by law to terminate this Agreement or the rights granted by Samsung; or (iii) if we stop providing the Developer Kit or Platform for any reason.

    13.2 ***What Happens when this Agreement Terminates.***  As long as we terminate this Agreement following the procedures in this Agreement, Samsung will have no liability to pay compensation or damages, or to provide an indemnity of any kind as a result of terminating this Agreement, and termination of this Agreement is without prejudice to any other right or remedy that Samsung may have, now or at any time in the future.  When this Agreement expires or terminates: (a) all rights granted to you in this Agreement will terminate; (b) you will immediately stop using the Developer Kit and return the Developer Kit to Samsung or destroy all electronic copies of the Developer Kit, and if Samsung requests you do so, provide written certification of such destruction to Samsung. The provisions of Sections Definitions, 2.3, 3, 5.1, 5.2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.2 and 11 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy Samsung may have now or in the future.

14. **General**

    14.1 ***Assignment.*** You may not assign the Agreement, in whole or in part, without Samsung’s prior written consent. Any attempt to do so without such consent shall be void. Samsung may assign this Agreement without your consent. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
    
    14.2 ***Relationship Between You and Samsung; Third Party Rights.*** This Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary duty, or any other form of legal relationship between you and Samsung, and you must not represent the existence of any such relationship, whether expressly, by implication or otherwise. This Agreement is not for the benefit of any third parties.

    14.3 ***Development by Samsung.*** Nothing in this Agreement limits or otherwise affects Samsung's right to acquire, develop, license, market, promote, or distribute any product or technology that performs the same or similar functions as the Developer Products or any other products or technologies that you develop, market, promote or distribute, or that otherwise competes with the Developer Products or such products or technologies.

    14.4 ***Notices.***  Any notices or other communication made pursuant to this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been fully given or made when: (a) personally delivered; or (b) three (3) days after being mailed via commercially reputable overnight delivery service, to the following address:

    A party may change its email or mailing address by giving the other party written notice in accordance with this section.

    14.5 ***Severability.*** If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable for any reason, that provision of this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. However, if applicable law prohibits or restricts you from fully and specifically complying with the Sections of this Agreement entitled "Grant of Developer License and Restrictions" or "Licensee’s Responsibilities" or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this Agreement will immediately terminate and you must immediately discontinue any use of the Developer Kit as described in the Section entitled “Termination.”

    14.6 ***No Waiver; Construction.*** Failure by Samsung to insist upon strict performance of any of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in no way constitute a waiver of Samsung’s rights as set forth in this Agreement, at law or in equity, or a waiver of any other provisions or the right to take action in respect of a subsequent default by you in the performance or compliance with any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Any laws or regulations that provide that the language of a contract will be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement.

####Minimum End User Terms and Conditions

As provided in Section 8.2(p) of the Agreement, if a Developer Product is expected to be made available to end users through the Platform, your End User License Agreement (“EULA”) will include the following minimum terms and conditions. 

Your EULA must:

1. Comply with all applicable laws in all countries where end users will purchase or download a Developer Product.
2. Provide that you and your end use will acknowledge that the EULA for your Developer Product is solely between you and your end user and Samsung will not be responsible for, and Samsung will not have any liability whatsoever under any EULA for any breach by you or any end user of any terms and conditions of your EULA.
3. Provide for usage rules for Developer Products that are at least as restrictive as any usage rules provided by Samsung through the Platform or the accompanying website.
4. Inform your end users and require your end users to acknowledge that you are solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services for your Developer Product, and that Samsung has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance or support services for your Developer Product.
5. Make you solely responsible for any product warranties. The EULA must also provide that, if the Developer Product does not conform to any applicable warranty, to the maximum extent permissible by law, Samsung will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Developer Product, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be your sole responsibility.
6. Provide that you, not Samsung, are responsible for addressing any claims of any end user or any third party relating to or arising from the Developer Product or end user’s possession or use of such Developer Product, including but not limited to any claims that the Developer product infringes any third party’s intellectual property rights, claims arising under any consumer protection, FDA or any other legal or regulatory requirement.
7. Require the end user to represent and warrant that such end user is not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that such end user is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
8. Provide your name, address and contact information (telephone number and email address) for end users to contact you with questions, complaints and/or claims with regard to the Developer Product.
9. Provide that Samsung and its affiliates are third party beneficiaries of your EULA, and upon the end user’s acceptance of the terms and conditions of the EULA, Samsung will have the right (and be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the EULA against the end user as a third party beneficiary.

In addition, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditions.

1. Allow your end users to review your EULA before or at the time your Developer Product is delivered to your end user.
2. Allow us to notify your end uses that their use of your Developer Product is subject to the terms and conditions of your Developer Product.
3. Agree that if you do not furnish a EULA for your end users, each end user’s use of your Developer Product is subject to our standard EULA.
